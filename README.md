# Projects 

## [XKube](https://github.com/EneVyctis/FirstYearProject), my first project. 
Xkube is a simple game inspired by TicTacToe. We aimed for coding that game, implement an AI to play alone and a multiplayer game mode to play with a friend.
## [Weaponator](https://github.com/EneVyctis/Weaponator), a school project. 
Weaponator is a unfinished project (technically, finished for the school standards) of 25 hours (approx.) to learn php with symfony.
