# Projects 

## [XKube](https://github.com/EneVyctis/FirstYearProject), my first project. 
Xkube is a simple game inspired by TicTacToe. We aimed to code that game, implement an AI to play alone and a multiplayer game mode to play with a friend.
The multiplayer server is no longer available tho, cause there is no sense of letting a server run with so few players (mostly me and a friend of mine). 
You can still test it by running the Nodejs server locally. 

## [Weaponator](https://github.com/EneVyctis/Weaponator), a school project. 
Weaponator is an unfinished project (technically, finished for the school standards) of 25 hours (approx.) to learn php with Symfony. 

## [ImprovedXKube](https://github.com/EneVyctis/ImprovedXCube), a cleaner, more powerful, more stable version of XKube.
I want to improve my first-ever project and make it available on the Play Store. The game and server will be coded in C# using Unity and ASP.NET

## [Magic Circus](https://github.com/AdriKat2022/AMJV-CTF).
Magic Circus is a school project group made to learn Unity.
